to install:

  sudo python ./setup.py install

this will create a python library called 'rfidiot'.

*** important:

as some scripts have moved from the execution path and into the library, you
should ensure that no old copies are left lying around. in particular, the
following files should only exist in your python DIST directory
(e.g. /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rfidiot), and not in /usr/local/bin:

  iso3166.py
  iso3166.pyc
  pn532.py
  pn532.pyc
  pyandroid.py
  pyandroid.pyc
  pynfc.py
  pynfc.pyc
  rfidiotglobals.py  
  rfidiotglobals.pyc
  RFIDIOt.py
  RFIDIOt.pyc

for a brief moment setup was configured to create e.g. /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/RFIDIOt
which was an error, so you can safely remove /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/RFIDIOt* or
your equivelant.

*** note - if you are upgrading from a version that didn't use an install script,
and you've written your own clients, you'll need to make the following changes:

  replace all instances of 'RFIDIOTconfig' with 'rfidiot'

  e.g.

    import RFIDIOtconfig

  becomes

    import rfidiot

  and

    args= RFIDIOtconfig.args

  becomes

     args= rfidiot.args

  etc.

everything else should behave the same as before. please inform me if you hit any snags!
